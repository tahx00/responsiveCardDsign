# Browser Extensions Manager UI

![Design preview for the Browser Extensions Manager UI coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## 📌 Overview

This is a solution to the **Frontend Mentor - Browser Extensions Manager UI challenge**.  
The goal was to build a **responsive UI** for managing browser extensions, with the ability to toggle, filter, and remove extensions.

## 🚀 Demo

👉 [Solution on Frontend Mentor](#)

## 🎯 Features

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter extensions by status (active / inactive)
- Remove extensions from the list
- Switch between **light and dark themes**
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Hover and focus states for all interactive elements

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Variables)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity
- JSON for local data simulation

## 💡 What I Learned

- Managing state with **vanilla JavaScript**
- Rendering UI dynamically from a `data.json` file
- Handling user interactions (toggle, filter, remove)
- Creating a responsive layout with **CSS Grid & Flexbox**

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Persist extension states using **localStorage**
- Add smooth animations for UI transitions
- Extend to a **real browser extension** with manifest.json
